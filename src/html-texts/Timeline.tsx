    public static intro = "Hey there! I am Nikos, a neuroscientist with strong analytical expertise and background, which gives me transferrable and useful skills to take into my career. Coding really fires my imagination and I enjoy all aspects of developing, in particular the problem solving aspect of it. I love nothing more than solving a complex issue and seeing my code run!";
    public static codeClanGraduation = "In November 2020 I started on Codeclan's Software Development Course. This is an Industry Led 16 week immersive course which is SQA approved and involved more than 800 hours of coding. It teaches software fundamentals and skills including Python, Javascript, Java, HTML, CSS, Agile methodologies, Restful API's and UX design. With a strong emphasis on the SOLID principles of OOP and Test Driven Development I have used the following technologies and frameworks; GitHub, PostgreSQL, Firebase, MongoDB, Express, Flask, Node.js, Socket.io and more. I graduated from CodeClan in March 2021."
    public static showcasePresentation = "Undoubtedly, CodeClan armed me with useful skills and helped me build a strong intuition about software engineering techniques, but, equally importantly, in this course I came closer with other people with whom we share common interests. Specifically, four of us formed a coding group and we meet regularly to progress with our projects and/or brainstorm about new ones. So far we have coded a 2D multiplayer checkers game which we recently presented to the Scottish Government, FanDuel, and other tech companies."
    public static NITS = "Finally, I submitted my Doctoral thesis! Or, to be precise, I submitted my intention to submit the thesis. I know, it sounds confusing, but NITS (Notice of Intention To Submit) is actually a required step before handing in the thesis. Formalities. According to graduate school’s instructions, it’ll take around 2 months until the proper submission for examination but that’s just a matter of time --sooner or later you may call me Dr. ;D"
