    public static intro = "Hello! I'm Nikos, a software engineer with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and a strong analytical background that provides me with valuable, transferable skills for my career. As a lead developer at a startup, I am passionate about coding and find great satisfaction in tackling the diverse challenges it presents. Problem-solving is an aspect I particularly enjoy, and there's nothing more rewarding than resolving intricate issues and watching my code come to life!";
    public static codeClanGraduation = "In November 2020 I started on Codeclan's Software Development Course. This is an Industry Led 16 week immersive course which is SQA approved and involved more than 800 hours of coding. It teaches software fundamentals and skills including Python, Javascript, Java, HTML, CSS, Agile methodologies, Restful API's and UX design. With a strong emphasis on the SOLID principles of OOP and Test Driven Development I have used the following technologies and frameworks; GitHub, PostgreSQL, Firebase, MongoDB, Express, Flask, Node.js, Socket.io and more. I graduated from CodeClan in March 2021."
    public static showcasePresentation = "CodeClan not only equipped me with valuable skills and a solid understanding of software engineering techniques, but it also provided me with the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals. Together with three other classmates, we formed a coding group that meets regularly to collaborate on projects and brainstorm new ideas. Thus far, we have developed a 2D multiplayer checkers game, which we recently presented to the Scottish Government, FanDuel, and other tech companies."
    public static NITS = "Finally, I submitted my Doctoral thesis! Or, to be precise, I submitted my intention to submit the thesis. I know, it sounds confusing, but NITS (Notice of Intention To Submit) is actually a required step before handing in the thesis. Formalities. According to graduate school’s instructions, it’ll take around 2 months until the proper submission for examination but that’s just a matter of time --sooner or later you may call me Dr.!"
